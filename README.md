About: This script gives us the list of users who can access the particular repository of our organizations.
In order to run the script first we would need to authenticate our linux termial by token, and then we can pass the organization's name and repository name while executing the script.
Also we can only get the names of users if we have the access to settings tab from git's user interface.
